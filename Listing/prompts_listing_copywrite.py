AMAZON LISTING – GLOBAL GUIDELINES (HARD RULES)

Write in ENGLISH. Follow Amazon style and policy. Do not violate any of these:

PROHIBITED CONTENT & FORMATS
- No promotional phrases (e.g., “free shipping”, “discount”, “on sale”, coupons, “#1/best”).
- No competitor mentions or comparisons.
- No subjective or unverifiable claims (“amazing”, “best”, “top-rated”) unless substantiated on-page.
- No phone numbers, emails, websites/URLs, or alternative ordering info.
- No time-sensitive claims (“just in time for…”, “limited time”).
- No HTML/JS except ALLOWED line breaks for Description: use <br><br> only.
- Avoid special characters: !, $, ?, _, {, }, ^, ¬, ¦ in surface copy. Use standard letters/numbers.
- Use numerals (2, 3…) instead of words (two, three…).
- No ALL CAPS for whole sentences; title case with normal capitalization rules.
- Avoid repetitions and keyword stuffing. Use clear, natural language.

PRODUCT TITLES (GLOBAL)
- Target ≤200 chars overall per Amazon policy; our Desktop/Mobile variants below are stricter.
- Do not repeat the same word more than twice (brand included).
- Allowed punctuation: hyphens (-), slashes (/), commas (,), ampersands (&), and periods (.).
- Capitalize first letter of each word except short articles/conjunctions/prepositions.
- Use only standard letters/numbers (no non-language ASCII like Æ, Œ, etc.).

BULLET POINTS
- 5 bullets required for our workflow.
- Each bullet: begin with ALL-CAPS HEADER then colon, followed by sentence fragment.
- >10 and <255 characters per Amazon; our workflow sets a narrower range below.
- Use semicolons to separate phrases within a bullet.
- No ending punctuation (no final period).
- Each bullet must be unique (no duplication across bullets).

DESCRIPTION
- Limit ~2000 characters max; our workflow sets a narrower range below.
- No HTML except <br><br> as paragraph break. Provide multiple paragraphs for readability.

BACKEND SEARCH TERMS (“Generic keywords”)
- Lowercase, space-separated tokens; no commas or punctuation.
- No brand names, ASINs, subjective claims, profanity, or temporary terms.
- Avoid articles, prepositions, and stop words (a, an, and, by, for, of, the, with).
- Use synonyms, abbreviations, and spelling variants; avoid common misspellings.
- Use either singular OR plural (not both) per token family.
- Byte limit applies; our workflow sets an exact window.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
EDITORIAL_BRIEF = r"""
EDITORIAL BRIEF – TABLE-DRIVEN BEHAVIOR

All copy is derived from a structured table with columns: Tipo, Contenido, Etiqueta, Fuente.
Your inputs are faithful projections of that table.

MAPPING (table → inputs here):
- Brand: rows where Tipo = "Marca" → may be present via head_phrases and/or explicit brand input. Do not invent a brand.
- Buyer Persona: rows where Tipo = "Buyer persona" → provided as buyer_persona (string).
- Emotions: rows where Tipo = "Emoción" → provided as emotions (list). Etiqueta 'Positive' amplifies desires; 'Negative' or 'CON' addresses pains/objections.
  Map only relevant ones to 8 core emotions: Status & Recognition; Financial Security; Time & Efficiency; Relationship & Connection;
  Confidence & Competence; Growth & Achievement; Safety & Peace of Mind; Pleasure & Enjoyment. Identify primary/secondary emotions internally.
- Benefits / Obstacles: captured in benefits list; weave PRO as advantages and CON as objections resolution.
- Lexicon & Tone: rows where Tipo = "Léxico editorial" → provided as lexico (string). Use those terms and stylistic cues verbatim where natural.
- SEO Semantics: rows where Tipo = "SEO semántico" (Etiqueta: Core/Cluster) → provided via core_tokens (Core preferred) and may also appear in variations/attributes.

PRIORITIES
- Be benefit-led, objection-aware, and persona-aligned.
- Maintain clarity + fluency; avoid redundancy and keyword stuffing.
- Prefer concrete attributes and measurable outcomes over fluff.

# 3) ELEMENT CONTRACTS – SPECIFIC RULES PER OUTPUT
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TITLE_CONTRACT = r"""
TITLE CONTRACT (DESKTOP & MOBILE, PER VARIATION)

GOAL
- Generate TWO titles per variation:
  • Desktop: 150–180 characters (including spaces)
  • Mobile: 75–80 characters (including spaces)

COMPOSITION (in order)
- Brand (if present; do not invent) + Product Name (built ONLY from core tokens to reflect the "what")
- Then a hyphen " - "
- Key Attributes (values only, not labels; draw them from items customers rated as important in reviews; ensure they are ATTRIBUTES, not variations)
- Then a hyphen " - "
- Variation (size/color/pack/etc.). One title object per distinct variation.

RULES
- Build the Product Name from CORE tokens ONLY (not from the short description).
  The short description is context to understand the product, not surface copy for the name.
- Attribute selection: use only the “value” that matches what reviews marked as important; if an item is a variation in the table, do NOT place it as attribute (avoid duplication).
- Fit as many high-priority attributes as space allows BEFORE hitting the char limit (desktop or mobile).
- No prohibited specials (!, $, ?, _, {, }, ^, ¬, ¦), no promo words, no competitors, ≤ 2 repeats of any word.
- Capitalization: Title Case for main words; standard Amazon style.
- Output per variation:
  {"variation": "<value>", "desktop": "<150–180 chars>", "mobile": "<75–80 chars>"}
"""

BULLETS_CONTRACT = r"""
BULLETS CONTRACT (5 BULLETS, VARIATION-AWARE WHEN NEEDED)

COUNT & FORMAT
- Exactly 5 bullets, each 130–180 characters.
- Each bullet begins with ALL-CAPS HEADER then colon, followed by a sentence fragment (no ending period).
- Use semicolons to separate phrases within a bullet when needed.

CONTENT & SOURCES
- Must incorporate keywords from the clustered SEO semantics (Core preferred) naturally.
- Blend “Benefits/Advantages” and address “Obstacles/Objections” grounded in reviews/persona.
- Use the editorial lexicon where relevant.
- Use “fascination” styles when appropriate to enhance curiosity/clarity:
  (e.g., HOW-TO, SECRET, WHY, WHAT-NEVER, NUMBER, WARNING, DIRECT BENEFIT, SPECIFIC QUESTION, IF-THEN, QUICK & EASY, TRUTH, BETTER, SINGLE).
  Apply them tastefully; at least two bullets should use fascination-style framing, without hype or prohibited claims.

VARIATION HANDLING
- If a bullet semantically targets a variation (e.g., pack size or color-dependent benefit), duplicate/adapt that bullet per variation and adjust the text coherently (e.g., “Pack of 2” vs “Pack of 4”).
- Otherwise, keep bullets generic across variations.

POLICY GUARDS
- No special characters, no competitors, no subjective superlatives, no repeated bullets.
- Use numerals; keep language natural; no keyword stuffing.
"""

DESCRIPTION_CONTRACT = r"""
DESCRIPTION CONTRACT (1500–1800 CHARS, READABLE PARAGRAPHS)

LENGTH & FORMAT
- 1500–1800 characters (including spaces).
- Plain text; separate paragraphs ONLY with <br><br>. Provide multiple paragraphs (no single block wall of text).

CONTENT SHAPE
- Narrative flow for high-intent Amazon context:
  1) Problem/pain & stakes (persona-aligned, use 'Negative' emotions as objections)
  2) Solution framing (product as answer) with concrete attributes → benefits (use 'Positive' emotions)
  3) Use cases/examples to visualize outcomes
  4) Subtle objection handling; clarity and confidence without hype
- Use editorial lexicon; integrate core semantic tokens naturally (no stuffing).
- Maintain clarity and specificity; avoid technical jargon unless essential (then explain simply).

POLICY GUARDS
- No prohibited characters, no competitors, no promo phrases, no subjective unverifiable claims.
- Keep language natural and consistent with bullets and titles.
"""

BACKEND_CONTRACT = r"""
BACKEND SEARCH TERMS CONTRACT (243–249 BYTES, SPACES EXCLUDED)

GOAL
- Produce a single lowercase, space-separated string of tokens.
- When removing spaces, total bytes must be 243–249 (UTF-8; avoid multi-byte symbols).
- Maximize coverage using allowed synonyms, abbreviations, and language variants.

SOURCES & INCLUSIONS
- Prioritize Core semantic tokens (lemmatized) and high-relevance long-tail derived from attributes/variations/use cases.
- Include Spanish equivalents of Core tokens (where meaningful for US/EU shoppers); keep everything lowercase and space-separated.
- Include safe abbreviations and variants; avoid common misspellings.

EXCLUSIONS
- No brand names, ASINs, competitor names.
- No subjective words (“best”, “cheapest”, etc.), no temporary terms (“new”, “on sale”).
- No punctuation; no articles/prepositions/stop-words (a, an, and, by, for, of, the, with).
- No duplication with surface copy is RECOMMENDED; prioritize distinct, discoverable tokens. (If minor overlap is inevitable, keep it minimal and useful.)
- Use either singular OR plural for each token family (not both).

OUTPUT
- A single string in the field "search_terms".
