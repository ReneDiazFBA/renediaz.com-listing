- Respect these HARD ranges:
  * Title: 150–200 characters.
  * Bullets: 180–240 characters each.
  * Description: 1600–2000 characters (plain text; paragraphs separated by <br><br>).
  * Backend: 243–249 BYTES, counting bytes with SPACES REMOVED (space is a separator only).
- Use clear benefits and concrete attributes. Avoid subjective claims.
- Do NOT include competitors.
- Backend must NOT repeat words already present in title/bullets/description.
- Backend may include common misspellings (typos) and terms in other languages when relevant.
- Use either plural OR singular forms (not both) for the same token family.

EDITORIAL BRIEF – INTEGRATED VERSION (BEHAVIORAL RULES)

All copy is derived from a structured table with columns: tipo, contenido, etiqueta.
Your inputs are pre-extracted lists from that table; treat them as faithful projections:

MAPPING (table → inputs you receive):
- Avatar (Buyer Persona): rows where tipo = "Buyer persona" → provided as buyer_persona (string).
- Emotions: rows where tipo = "Emoción" → provided as emotions (list). etiqueta='Positivo' reinforce desires; etiqueta='Negativo' or 'CON' address pain/objections.
  Map only relevant ones to the 8 core emotions: Status & Recognition; Financial Security; Time & Efficiency; Relationship & Connection;
  Confidence & Competence; Growth & Achievement; Safety & Peace of Mind; Pleasure & Enjoyment. Identify primary and secondary emotions.
- Story / Narrative: rows where tipo = "Obstáculo" and tipo = "Beneficio" → already summarized within benefits (list) and persona/lexicon.
  Use PRO to emphasize advantages/desirable outcomes; use CON to acknowledge pains and pivot to resolution.
- Placement: Amazon product page (high intent). Copy Triangle System:
  Where → Amazon; Why → purchase intent; What → conversion.
  Structure: start with problem/pain → agitate consequences → introduce the product as solution → relatable examples/use cases.
  Best practices: benefit-led headlines, address objections, mix logic + emotion. CTAs must be subtle and compliant (no explicit “Buy now”).
- Objective / Descripción breve: rows where tipo = "Descripción breve" → provided implicitly via benefits/persona/lexicon. Goal: conversion with specificity and personalization.
- Lexicon & Tone: rows where tipo = "Léxico editorial" → provided as lexico (string). Use those exact terms and style cues.
- Brand: if the table contains tipo = "marca", it may be present inside head_phrases or attributes/variations strings.
  If a brand-like value is present in your inputs, prepend it to the Title as Brand.
  If not present, do not invent a brand.

FORMATS TO PRODUCE:
- Title (150–200 chars): follow exactly → Brand (if available) + Product Name + Product Type + 1–2 Key Feature(s) + Use Case + Size/Quantity/Color.
  Keep it tight and non-redundant.
- Bullets (5 × 180–240 chars): each bullet MUST start with an ALL-CAPS HEADER followed by a colon, then the sentence.
  Pattern: HEADER: concise sentence that combines Attribute + Benefit + Use case. Use sensory/experiential language when appropriate.
- Description (1600–2000 chars): plain text; separate paragraphs with <br><br>. Blend story with benefits and objections for the avatar.
- Backend (243–249 bytes without spaces): space-separated tokens; no commas/HTML; do not repeat any surface words; may include typos/other languages; enforce singular OR plural (not both).
